==Overview
This is a fork of Smoothie [[http://smoothieware.org/]] which is a free, opensource, high performance G-code interpreter and CNC controller written in Object-Oriented C++ for the LPC17xx micro-controller ( ARM Cortex M3 architecture ). It will run on a mBed, a LPCXpresso, a SmoothieBoard, R2C2, MotionBoard or any other LPC17xx-based board. The motion control part is a port of the awesome grbl.

These instructions are targetted at the MotionBoard connected to an EMC02 board from : [[http://firepickdelta.dozuki.com]]

NOTE it is not necessary to build Smoothie yourself unless you want to. Prebuilt binaries are availble here in the following file location : Firmware/firmware.bin

==Quick Start
These are the quick steps to get Smoothie dependencies installed on your computer:
* Pull down a clone of the Smoothie github project to your local machine.
* In the root subdirectory of the cloned Smoothie project, there are install scripts for the supported platforms.  Run the install script appropriate for your platform:
** Windows: win_install.cmd
** OS X: mac_install
** Linux: linux_install
* You can then run the BuildShell script which will be created during the install to properly configure the PATH environment variable to point to the required version of GCC for ARM which was just installed on your machine.  You may want to edit this script to further customize your development environment.

NOTE: all commands are case-sensitive 

==Building Smoothie
From a shell, you need to start a "BuildShell", so go to the root Smoothie project directory and run:
{{{
./BuildShell
make clean
make all
}}}

To upload you can do

{{{
make upload
}}}

if you have dfu-util installed.

Alternatively copy the file LPC1768/main.bin to the sdcard calling it firmware.bin and reset.

==Getting you FirePick Delta operational
Onto a blank FAT32 formatted SD card, copy the following files
{{{
Firmware/firmware.bin
ConfigSamples/Firepick.delta/config
}}}
Press reset on your SmoothieBoard or MotionBoard (This is the FirePick derivate of the Smoothieware board and is recommended for you FirePick delta) and wait a few moments while the new firmware is loaded into flash memory, and then executed.

==Z-Probing & Calibrating
The config file is already configured for Z-Probing.

(1) Attach the Z-Probe between 1.27 and GND (Normally open, closed when the probe is activated)

Note that Smoothie requires you to define its trigger point in terms of an offset of X/Y/Z from the origin (0/0/0), when we have a tool head that is a Z-Probe, I will integrate that into the config file, in the mean time, you will need to update the leveling-strategy.ZGrid-leveling.probe_ofsets X,Y,Z parameter, e.g.
{{{
leveling-strategy.ZGrid-leveling.probe_ofsets 29,7,1.1
}}}
(2) Issue the automated Z-Probe command
{{{
G32
}}}

If it does something very strange, for example the Z-Probe misses the bed, press the RESET button on your MotionBoard or SmoothieBoard and then figure out mechanically what is wrong.

(3) Place an engineers steel ruler along the X-axis so Y=0 on the bed and the centre of the tool you have in the ATD is directly above 100mm on the ruler.

(4) Issue a 
{{{
G0X100
}}}
command and see how close to 200mm it gets to (remember that X=-100 is 0 on the ruler, X=0 is 100 on the ruler and X=+100 is 200 on the ruler) and note the difference.

(5) Issue a 
{{{
G0X0
}}}
and check that it returns to 100mm on the ruler.

(6) Issue a 
{{{
G0X-100
}}}
and measure the deviation from 0mm on the ruler.

(7) The deviations in steps (4) and (6) should be the same; if not, then you need to re-align the arm supports so they are the same (shims, etc)
NOTE: you will observe that as a result of step (2), your FPD should be tracking much closer to horizontal on the Z Plane (i.e. X & Y movements, in this case, near Z=0), but we are not there yet.

(8) Using the difference in (4) and (6):
(a) issue an
{{{
M92
}}}
and read the values for X/Y/Z as these are the steps/mm Smoothie uses to drive the FirePick's Rotary Delta arm solution, these should all be the same value. e.g. M92 returns M92X338Y338Z338 (plus other things we donâ€™t care about).

(b) Determine the ratio of the difference as 100/difference measured e.g. 100/104=0.961538

(c) Calculate the what the steps/mm should be as the value from (9a) multiplied by the (9b) ratio e.g.  338*0.961538=325

(d) issue and
{{{
M92X<value from (9c)>Y<value from (9c)>Z<value from (9c)>
}}}
 e.g. 
{{{
 M92X325Y325Z325
}}}
(9) Repeat this process from (2) until you are happy with your set up (it may take several iterations as the approximation in step (8) needs to be iteratively refined).

(10) Issue a 
{{{
M30 ZGrid
}}}
command to delete any previous ZGrid compensation file off your SD card in the MotionBoard.

(11) Issue a 
{{{
M374
}}}
which saves the deviations in a 
{{{
ZGrid
}}}
file on the SD card on the MotionBoard/Smoothie Board.

Now, when ever you start the FPD, issue a M375 and this loads you compensation file from the SD card and applies the necessary corrections to Smoothie, and then away you go.

Using the above method I an getting rather good 3D printing, but I notice that downward movement in the Z axis still exhibits an increasing outward deviation as Z moves from say 100mm down to 0mm the further out the head is from X/Y = 0, i.e. towards the out parts of the bed, though this is substantially reduced by the above process, but is not quite perfect.
==3D Printing - Important hardware fix for the MotionBoard + EMC02
There is currently an issue where the Thermistors are not connected to the VREFP on the LPC1769 so you get crazy temperature readings, typically 20 degress C below what they are.

Here is a low cost fix to get you started on 3D printing.

First, here is the issue:
{{Thermistor-fix\EAT001_problem.jpg|On the EAT001 board, the thermistor no connected to VREFP on the LPC1769}}

The fix is to remove R8 and instead wire R8 to the VREFP on the MotionBoard.
{{Thermistor-fix\EAT001_pcb.JPB|Here is where R8 normally resides on the back of the EAT001 PCB}}
{{Thermistor-fix\Resistor.JPG|Remove R8 and solder two wires to it, then cover in heat-shrink to protect it}}
{{Thermistor-fix\closeup_of_modified_EAT001.JPG|This is how the EAT001 now looks with R8 removed and one end routed to the AIN of the EAT001 PCB, so the other can got to the MotionBoard}}
{{Thermistor-fix\Replace_Connector.JPG|Now we need to repalce the two pin connector with a 3 pin connector so we can easily get at the "VREF" which we will wire to VREFP on the LPC1769}}
{{Thermistor-fix\Add_Wire_Link.JPG|Now we need to put a wire between the VREF pin and the AREFP on the MotionBoard PCB}}
{{Thermistor-fix\IMG_6814.JPG|ANd here is where we connected the other end of the 4k7 wire to AREF which is really VREFP}}

Now we get the correct readings!!

==OpenPnP
I am well advanced on the changes to the config file to support OpenPnP and hope to have those changes tested and committed before the end of July.
