==Overview
Smoothie is a free, opensource, high performance G-code interpreter and CNC controller written in Object-Oriented C++ for the LPC17xx micro-controller ( ARM Cortex M3 architecture ). It will run on a mBed, a LPCXpresso, a SmoothieBoard, R2C2 or any other LPC17xx-based board. The motion control part is a port of the awesome grbl.

Documentation can be found here : [[http://smoothieware.org/]]

NOTE it is not necessary to build Smoothie yourself unless you want to. prebuilt binaries are availble here http://builds.smoothieware.org/

==Quick Start
These are the quick steps to get Smoothie dependencies installed on your computer:
* Pull down a clone of the Smoothie github project to your local machine.
* In the root subdirectory of the cloned Smoothie project, there are install scripts for the supported platforms.  Run the install script appropriate for your platform:
** Windows: win_install.cmd
** OS X: mac_install
** Linux: linux_install
* You can then run the BuildShell script which will be created during the install to properly configure the PATH environment variable to point to the required version of GCC for ARM which was just installed on your machine.  You may want to edit this script to further customize your development environment.

==Building Smoothie
From a shell, switch into the root Smoothie project directory and run:
{{{
make clean
make all
}}}

To upload you can do

{{{
make upload
}}}

if you have dfu-util installed.

Alternatively copy the file LPC1768/main.bin to the sdcard calling it firmware.bin and reset.

==Getting you FirePick Delta operational
Onto a blank FAT32 formatted SD card, copy the following files
{{{
Firmware/firmware.bin
ConfigSamples/Firepick.delta/config
}}}
Press reset on your SmoothieBoard or MotionBaord (This is the FirePick derivate of the Smoothieware board and is recommended for you FirePick delta) and wait a few moments while the new firmware is loaded into flash memory, and then executed.

==Z-Probing & Calibrating
The config file is already configured for Z-Probing.

(1) Attach the Z-Probe between 1.27 and GND (Normally open, closed when the probe is activated)

Note that Smoothie requires you to define its trigger point in terms of an offset of X/Y/Z from the origin (0/0/0), when we have a tool head that is a Z-Probe, I will integrate that into the config file, in the mean time, you will need to update the leveling-strategy.ZGrid-leveling.probe_ofsets X,Y,Z parameter, e.g.
{{{
leveling-strategy.ZGrid-leveling.probe_ofsets 29,7,1.1
}}}
(2) Issue the automated Z-Probe command
{{{
G32
}}}

(3) Place an engineers steel ruler along the X-axis so Y=0 on the bed and the centre of the tool you have in the ATD is directly above 100mm on the ruler

(4) Issue a 
{{{
G0X100
}}}
command and see how close to 200mm it gets to (remember that X=-100 is 0 on the ruler, X=0 is 100 on the ruler and X=+100 is 200 on the ruler) and note the difference.

(5) Issue a 
{{{
G0X0
}}}
and check that it returns to 100mm on the ruler

(6) Issue a 
{{{
G0X-100
}}}
and measure the deviation from 0mm on the ruler.

(7) The deviations in steps (4) and (6) should be the same; if not, then you need to re-align the arm supports so they are the same (shims, etc)
NOTE: you will observe that as a result of step (2), your FPD should be tracking much closer to horizontal on the Z Plane (i.e. X & Y movements, in this case, near Z=0), but we are not there yet.

(8) Using the difference in (4) and (6):
(a) issue an
{{{
M92
}}}
and read the values for X/Y/Z as these are the steps/mm Smoothie uses to drive the FirePick's Rotary Delta arm solution, these should all be the same value. e.g. M92 returns M92X338Y338Z338 (plus other things we donâ€™t care about)

(b) Determine the ratio of the difference as 100/difference measured e.g. 100/104=0.961538

(c) Calculate the what the steps/mm should be as the value from (9a) multiplied by the (9b) ratio e.g.  338*0.961538=325

(d) issue and
{{{
M92X<value from (9c)>Y<value from (9c)>Z<value from (9c)>
}}}
 e.g. 
{{{
 M92X325Y325Z325
}}}
(9) Repeat this process from (2) until you are happy with your set up (it may take several iterations as the approximation in step (8) needs to be iteratively refined)

(10) Issue a 
{{{
M30
}}}
Z-Grid command to delete any previous Z-Grid compensation file off your SD card in the MotionBoard

(11) Issue a 
{{{
M374
}}}
which saves the deviations in a 
{{{
ZGrid
}}}
file on the SD card on the MotionBoard/Smoothie Board.

Now, when ever you start the FPD, issue a M375 and this loads you compensation file from the SD card and applies the necessary corrections to Smoothie, and then away you go.

Using the above method I an getting rather good 3D printing, but I notice that downward movement in the Z axis still exhibits an increasing outward deviation as Z moves from say 100mm down to 0mm the further out the head is from X/Y = 0, i.e. towards the out parts of the bed, though this is substantially reduced by the above process, but is not quite perfect.

==OpenPnP
I am well advanced on the changes to the config file to support OpenPnP and hope to have those changes tested and committed before the end of July.
